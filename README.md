#Motion Capture

The program that does the following:

- Allows the user to select several frames in one AMC file as key frames or key poses. It also records the time of each key frame.
- Displays all key poses.
- Implements the Catmull-Rom algorithm to interpolate poses for in-between frames.
- Displays interpolated motions (To evaluate the quality of interpolated motions, you can compare interpolated motions with the original .amc files).
